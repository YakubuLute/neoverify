- **Template_Manager**: The subsystem that manages reusable document templates for consistent document creation
- **Access_Control_System**: The security layer that manages user permissions and document visibility
- **Audit_Trail**: The logging system that tracks all document-related activities for compliance and security
- **Bulk_Upload_System**: The feature that allows multiple documents to be uploaded simultaneously
- **Document_Status_Tracker**: The system that monitors and updates document processing states
