# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Express.js backend API for the NeoVerify document verification system. The backend will provide RESTful APIs for authentication, document management, user profiles, organization management, and integration with blockchain and AI verification services.

## Glossary

- **Express_Backend**: The Node.js Express.js server application that provides RESTful API endpoints
- **Authentication_Service**: Service responsible for user login, registration, JWT token management, and MFA
- **Document_API**: RESTful endpoints for document upload, retrieval, verification, and management
- **User_Profile_API**: Endpoints for managing user profile information and preferences
- **Organization_API**: Endpoints for organization management, user roles, and permissions
- **Verification_Engine**: Integration layer with AI forensics and blockchain verification services
- **Database_Layer**: Data persistence layer using Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Middleware_Stack**: Express middleware for authentication, error handling, logging, and validation
- **API_Gateway**: Central routing and request handling system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust authentication system, so that users can securely register, login, and manage their accounts with proper JWT token handling and MFA support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data, THE Authentication_Service SHALL validate the input and create a new user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user attempts to login with valid credentials, THE Authentication_Service SHALL generate and return a JWT access token and refresh token
3. WHEN a user enables MFA, THE Authentication_Service SHALL support TOTP-based two-factor authentication
4. WHEN an authenticated request is made, THE Middleware_Stack SHALL validate the JWT token and attach user context to the request
5. WHEN a refresh token is used, THE Authentication_Service SHALL generate a new access token if the refresh token is valid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage documents through API endpoints, so that I can store, retrieve, and organize my documents with proper metadata and file handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document, THE Document_API SHALL accept multipart form data and store the file with proper metadata
2. WHEN a user requests their documents, THE Document_API SHALL return a paginated list of documents with filtering and sorting options
3. WHEN a user requests a specific document, THE Document_API SHALL return the document details and provide secure file download links
4. WHEN a user updates document metadata, THE Document_API SHALL validate and persist the changes
5. WHEN a user deletes a document, THE Document_API SHALL perform soft deletion and maintain audit trails

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile and preferences through API endpoints, so that I can update personal information, notification settings, and verification preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their profile, THE User_Profile_API SHALL return complete profile information including preferences
2. WHEN a user updates profile information, THE User_Profile_API SHALL validate and persist the changes
3. WHEN a user updates notification preferences, THE User_Profile_API SHALL store the preferences and apply them to future notifications
4. WHEN a user changes their password, THE User_Profile_API SHALL validate the current password and update with proper encryption
5. WHEN a user updates MFA settings, THE User_Profile_API SHALL handle TOTP setup and backup codes generation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an organization admin, I want to manage organization settings and users through API endpoints, so that I can control access, roles, and organizational configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin requests organization details, THE Organization_API SHALL return organization information and user list with roles
2. WHEN an admin invites a user, THE Organization_API SHALL send invitation emails and create pending user records
3. WHEN an admin updates user roles, THE Organization_API SHALL validate permissions and update user access levels
4. WHEN an admin updates organization settings, THE Organization_API SHALL validate and persist configuration changes
5. WHEN an admin removes a user, THE Organization_API SHALL deactivate the user and revoke access while maintaining audit trails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system, I want to integrate with external verification services, so that documents can be processed through AI forensics and blockchain verification with proper error handling and status tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document verification is requested, THE Verification_Engine SHALL initiate AI forensics analysis and return a tracking ID
2. WHEN verification results are received, THE Verification_Engine SHALL update document status and store verification metadata
3. WHEN blockchain registration is requested, THE Verification_Engine SHALL interact with blockchain service and store transaction hashes
4. WHEN external services are unavailable, THE Verification_Engine SHALL implement retry logic and graceful error handling
5. WHEN verification status is queried, THE Verification_Engine SHALL return current status and progress information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that the API provides consistent error responses and maintains detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs, THE Middleware_Stack SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN requests are processed, THE Middleware_Stack SHALL log request details, response times, and error information
3. WHEN validation fails, THE Express_Backend SHALL return detailed validation error messages with field-specific information
4. WHEN database errors occur, THE Database_Layer SHALL handle connection issues and provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded, THE Middleware_Stack SHALL return appropriate rate limiting responses with retry information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database integration and data persistence, so that all application data is stored reliably with proper relationships and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Database_Layer SHALL establish connection to PostgreSQL database with proper configuration
2. WHEN data models are defined, THE Database_Layer SHALL create and maintain database tables with proper relationships and constraints
3. WHEN database operations are performed, THE Database_Layer SHALL handle transactions and ensure data consistency
4. WHEN database migrations are needed, THE Database_Layer SHALL support schema versioning and migration scripts
5. WHEN database queries are executed, THE Database_Layer SHALL implement proper indexing and query optimization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-structured API endpoints with proper CORS and security headers, so that the frontend application can communicate securely with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-origin requests are made, THE Express_Backend SHALL handle CORS with proper origin validation
2. WHEN API responses are sent, THE Express_Backend SHALL include appropriate security headers for protection
3. WHEN API documentation is needed, THE Express_Backend SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
4. WHEN file uploads are processed, THE Express_Backend SHALL validate file types, sizes, and implement security scanning
5. WHEN API versioning is implemented, THE Express_Backend SHALL support multiple API versions with proper routing
